Now that we have a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects, it's time to breathe life into them!

Before diving into the development of a large and intricate web application, we'll take a step-by-step approach to building the front end.

Our initial focus will be on "designing," "sketching," or "prototyping" each element:

We'll create simple HTML static pages.
Develop a style guide.
Populate them with fake contents.
Avoid integrating Javascript.
Abstain from loading data from external sources.
Throughout this project, I will delve into the manipulation of HTML and CSS languages. HTML, being the structural backbone of the page, takes precedence in the development process. CSS, on the other hand, defines the aesthetic aspects of the page, constituting its design. Indeed, without a solid structure provided by HTML, applying any design becomes impractical.
